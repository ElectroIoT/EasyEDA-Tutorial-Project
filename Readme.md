## üöÄ About This Repository

This repository is **your one-stop hub for EasyEDA projects** demonstrated on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ElectroIoT-IN).  
Every project comes with files, schematics, and Gerber, and is open for you to learn, use, or even improve (pull requests are always welcome ‚Äì like a good cup of tea!).

My goal?  
**25 complete, step-by-step projects** with practical value for hobbyists, students, and pros.  
Currently, there are **2 projects** ‚Äì and we‚Äôre just getting started!
